# Advanced Features Implementation Guide

This document provides details on the implementation of advanced features in the Restoran restaurant website.

## 1. Augmented Reality (AR) Menu Previews

### Implementation Details

The AR feature allows customers to visualize dishes in 3D before ordering. This is implemented using a model-viewer approach:

1. **Backend Support**:
   - Extended the Menu model to include AR model data (URL, type, dimensions)
   - Updated menu controller to handle AR model data
   - Added AR fields to the admin interface for menu management

2. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - AR preview buttons on menu items
   - Modal for displaying AR content
   - Integration with model-viewer library (conceptual)

### Usage

1. Admins can add AR model data when creating/editing menu items:
   - Model URL (path to 3D model file)
   - Model type (GLB, GLTF, OBJ, FBX)
   - Thumbnail image
   - Dimensions (width, height, depth)

2. Customers can click the "AR Preview" button on any menu item with AR data to visualize the dish.

## 2. Voice-Activated Ordering System

### Implementation Details

The voice ordering system uses the Web Speech API to allow customers to place orders using voice commands:

1. **Backend Support**:
   - Added voice keyword field to Menu model
   - Updated menu controller to handle voice keywords

2. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - Voice activation button in the interface
   - Voice command processing (simulated in this implementation)
   - Integration with Web Speech API (conceptual)

### Usage

1. Admins can set voice keywords for menu items (e.g., "chicken burger", "margherita pizza")
2. Customers click the voice button and speak their order
3. The system recognizes the command and adds items to the cart

## 3. Chatbot for Quick Assistance

### Implementation Details

The chatbot provides instant assistance to customers with common questions:

1. **Implementation**:
   - Dedicated chatbot widget with toggle button
   - Keyword-based response system
   - Simulated AI responses for common queries

### Usage

1. Customers click the chatbot icon to open the assistant
2. Type questions about menu, hours, reservations, etc.
3. Receive instant responses from the chatbot

## 4. Smart QR Code Ordering

### Implementation Details

QR code ordering allows customers to scan a code at their table to access the menu:

1. **Implementation**:
   - QR code generation functionality
   - Table-based ordering system (conceptual)
   - Mobile-optimized menu display

### Usage

1. Customers scan the QR code at their table
2. Access the digital menu on their smartphone
3. Place orders directly from their device

## 5. Multi-Language and Accessibility Support

### Implementation Details

The system supports multiple languages and accessibility features:

1. **Multi-Language Support**:
   - Language detection based on browser settings
   - Manual language selection dropdown
   - Translation system for UI elements

2. **Accessibility Features**:
   - High contrast mode
   - Screen reader support
   - Audio descriptions for menu items
   - Keyboard navigation support

### Usage

1. Language automatically detected or manually selected
2. Accessibility features can be enabled through UI controls
3. Admins can add accessibility data when creating menu items

2. **Advanced Voice Recognition**: Implement more sophisticated NLP for voice commands
3. **Real-time Chatbot**: Connect chatbot to a real AI service
4. **Dynamic QR Codes**: Generate unique QR codes for each table
5. **Expanded Language Support**: Add more languages and localization features
6. **Enhanced Accessibility**: Implement WCAG 2.1 compliance features

## Browser Support

These features work best in modern browsers:
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

Some features may have limited functionality in older browsers.
